/*
To the Util Class add â€‹ dayOfWeek static function that takes a date as input and
prints the day of the week that date falls on. Your program should take three
command-line arguments: m (month), d (day), and y (year). For m use 1 for January,
2 for February, and so forth. For output print 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, 2 for
Tuesday, and so forth. Use the following formulas, for the Gregorian calendar (where
/ denotes integer division):
